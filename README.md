## Introduction

ProTechIT provided an excellent platform for me to showcase my skills in machine learning using Python. The challenges tested my ability to implement essential algorithms and techniques to solve real-world problems. This repository serves as a testament to my problem-solving capabilities in the field of machine learning.

## Challenges

The challenges encompassed a diverse set of tasks, including:

- **Linear Regression**: Implementing a linear regression model to predict numerical values based on given input features.

- **Logistic Regression**: Building a logistic regression model for binary classification problems.

- **K-means Clustering**: Utilizing the k-means clustering algorithm to group data into clusters.

- **Basic Visualization**: Creating visualizations to gain insights from the data and interpret the results.

- **Python Problems**: Solving various Python coding problems that test programming skills and logic.

## File Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
